# svelte based dice roller

somehow it seems that the dice roller is my own TODO-app - you know, an app to learn how to
use a framework.

I already have

- [an Angular version](https://github.com/kabarakh/diceRollerV2)
- a only privately available AngularJS version
- there might be a react or vue version at some point

But this is the svelte version ;)

## Installation

Just clone the repo and run `npm install` - everything should be up to date then

## Usage

Just run `npm run dev` for a local instance...
